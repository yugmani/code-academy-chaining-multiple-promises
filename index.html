    <h2>Chaining Multiple Promises</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One common pattern weâ€™ll see with asynchronous programming is multiple operations which depend on each other to execute or that must be executed in a certain order. </li>
      <li>We might make one request to a database and use the data returned to us to make another request and so on!</li>
      <li>This process of chaining promises together is called <code style="background-color: lightgray"><em>composition</code></em>. Promises are designed with composition in mind! </li>
